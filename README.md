# Minecraft Server Setup with PaperMC

This GitLab repository provides a simple bash script for setting up a Minecraft server using PaperMC on a Linux system. The script automates the process of installing Java, creating a dedicated Minecraft user, downloading PaperMC, and setting up a systemd service for easy server management.

## Prerequisites

- This script is designed to run on a Linux system with `systemd` (e.g., Ubuntu).
- Ensure you have root privileges or run the script with `sudo`.

## Usage

1. Clone this repository or download the script directly.

```bash
git clone https://code.wonic.de/ashio/minecraft-installer.git
cd minecraft-installer
```

2. Make the script executable.

```bash
chmod +x installer.sh
```

3. Run the script.

```bash
./installer.sh
```

## Script Details

The script performs the following steps:

1. Checks if the script is run as root.
2. Updates the system and installs Java (OpenJDK 17).
3. Creates a dedicated Minecraft user (`minecraft`) and adjusts permissions on the Minecraft directory.
4. Downloads the specified version of PaperMC.
5. Creates a systemd service for managing the Minecraft server.

## Configuration

- You can customize the Minecraft version by modifying the download link in the script.
- Adjust the `minecraft.service` file if you need to change server configurations.

## Post-Setup

After running the script, the server is ready to use. Additional instructions are provided upon completion:

- Start the server using:

```bash
sudo systemctl start minecraft
```

- Enable automatic startup at boot:

```bash
sudo systemctl enable minecraft
```
